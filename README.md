Whoa. Just stumbled out of the theater, and my mind is racing like a million popcorn kernels popping all at once. Cleaner was... something, lemme tell you. The seats were kinda uncomfortable, felt like sitting on rocks, my back's not thanking me. Just this gritty, intense vibe swirling around the whole time. That opening scene—felt like I was plunged into another world, dude. That guy, what's his name, the lead? He had this haunted look, like a raccoon caught raiding trash cans in the full glare of headlights.

> Why did nobody tell me the soundtrack would be this pulsating? It's like my chest was its own bass drum. Almost spilled my soda at that one part... you know the one, where the walls seemed to move like they were alive. The plot? Hah. Like a jigsaw puzzle with pieces from a dozen different boxes. You start seeing connections and bam—nope, wrong again, but in a good way? Twisted satisfaction.

There was this SCENE, you wouldn't believe it—cleaning up messes, literal and metaphorical. I'm sitting there, crumbs everywhere, and the irony hits me. Can't spoil it, but I kept thinking, Do I clean the crumbs or let them be a part of the experience? Like life's just as much about the mess under the seats as the   on the screen. 

The cast, though! They delivered lines like they were handing out mystery candies—never knew if it was gonna be sweet, bitter, or flat-out weird. One dude, his voice was like gravel being poured slowly onto velvet. Crazy, right? Couldn’t 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   after but thought maybe I'll go 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again before anyone spoils it.

Oh man, one point there’s this dog—made me think of my uncle’s old basset hound that never moved, yet somehow was always where you didn't want it to be. Confusing, but makes sense, doesn't it? Probably not. Did I even mention the lighting? Bruh, it played tricks on your eyes like shadows playing dodgeball.

Feet asleep, circulation cut off—gotta get up but the theater air feels thick. Still, heads buzzing like a cheap electric toothbrush. Oh, someone asked if they could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , but seeing on the big screen’s a whole different beast.

Errr... wait, what's this unrelated code doing here?

```python
def whereDidThisComeFrom():
    for i in range(notReallySure):
        print(make it stop)
    return weirdEnding
```
